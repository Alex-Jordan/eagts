These are my working notes on using Sage. One aim is to provide a useful range of examples showing how Sage can be used in graph theory and combinatorics.

Sage, and the packages it is built on, are the result of a lot of effort by a large number of people. I am hoping that these notes can also be viewed as a constructive ``thank you.''  (CDG)

\begin{para}
Algebraic graph theory is a beautiful subject and Sage is an ideal place to experiment with the relevant mathematics: graph theory, linear algebra and permutation groups, along with combinatorics generally.  I am hoping these notes will provide a useful introduction for the student or researcher, while simultaneously aiding the continual improvement of Sage itself.  (RAB)
