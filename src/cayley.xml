        <title>Cayley Graphs</title>

        <p>If \(G\) is a group and \(C\sbs G\) (<ie />, a list of some elements of \(G\)), then we can produce the Cayley graph \(X(G,C)\):</p>

        <sage doctest="not tested">
            <input>
            G = DihedralGroup(5)
            C = [G.gen(0), G.gen(1)]
            CG = G.cayley_graph( generators = C)
            CG.show()
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>The output is a directed graph, even if \(C\) is inverse-closed; in the latter case we can convert \(G\) to a graph by</p>

        <sage  doctest="not tested">
            <input>
            CGU = CG.to_undirected()
            CGU.show()
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>Note that \(C\) is not required to generate \(G\). There are a number of keywords to this command (for example, <c>side</c> and <c>simple</c>) but I cannot follow their documentation and so I do not know what they do.</p>

        <p>Note that the <c>Graph()</c> command makes it easy to construct Cayley graphs ourselves. For example, a <term>cubelike graph</term> is a Cayley graph for \(GF(2)^d\). We can construct them using <c>Graph()</c>.</p>

        <sage>
            <input>
            def cubelike(d, vector_list):
                VS = VectorSpace(GF(2),d)
                vxs = range(2^d)
                return Graph([vxs, lambda i,j: VS[i]-VS[j] in vector_list])
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>Here <c>vector_list</c> is a list of 01-vectors of length \(d\).</p>

        <sage doctest="not tested">
            <input>
            V = GF(2)^5
            vl = [V([0,1,1,0,0]), V([1,1,0,1,1]), V([1,0,0,0,1])]
            T = cubelike(5, vl)
            show(T, layout='circular')
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>For a general group, we can use the following construction to create an undirected Cayley graph.</p>

        <sage doctest="not tested">
            <input>
            G = DihedralGroup(5)
            C = [G.gen(0), G.gen(0)^-1, G.gen(1), G.gen(1)^-1]
            CG = Graph( [ G.list(), lambda g, h: h*g^(-1) in C])
            CG.show()
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>This will produce an incorrect result if \(C\) is not inverse-closed.</p>

        <p>Sage provides access to GAP, and hence access to any group that is in GAP or can be constructed in GAP.  Be warned that the documentation for GAP probably outweighs that for Sage.</p>

        <title>The Higman-Sims Graph</title>

        <p>We construct the famous Higman-Sims graph as a Cayley graph for a permutation group. Our code is based on an <url href="http://www.combinatorics.org/Volume_10/PDF/v10i1r17.pdf">interesting paper</url> by Jorgensen and Klin from the Electronic Journal of Combinatorics. They provide constructions for a number of srg's on 100 vertices.</p>

        <p>First we form a permutation group.</p>

        <sage>
            <input>
            H1 = PermutationGroup([[(1,2,3,4,5)], [(6,7,8,9,10)], [(2,3,5,4)]])
            H1
            </input>
            <output>Permutation Group with generators [(6,7,8,9,10), (2,3,5,4), (1,2,3,4,5)]</output>
        </sage>

        <p>The argument to <c>PermutationGroup()</c> is a list where each item in the list is a list of cycles. Using <c>H1.order()</c> shows that <c>H1</c> has order 100 while <c>H1.gens()</c> provides a list of generators<mdash/>naturally they are the three elements we used, but in a different order. The command <c>H1.cayley_graph()</c> will return a directed Cayley graph using the elements of <c>H.gens()</c> as the connection set.</p>

        <p>Obviously, to get the Higman-Sims graph we need a special connection set. For this we make use of the following set of 22 triples:</p>

        <sage>
            <input>
            ds = [(1,0,0), (4,0,0), (0,1,1), (0,4,1), (2,0,1), (4,2,1),
                  (4,3,1), (0,1,2), (0,4,2), (1,2,2), (1,3,2), (2,0,2),
                  (3,1,2), (3,2,2), (3,3,2), (3,4,2), (4,0,2), (0,1,3),
                  (0,4,3), (1,0,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3)]
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>We set</p>

        <sage>
            <input>y,z,x = H1.gens()</input>
        </sage>

        <p>and then create a connection set</p>

        <sage>
            <input>
            C = [ x^it[0]*y^it[1]*z^it[2] for it in ds]
            C
            </input>
            <output>
            [(1,2,3,4,5), (1,5,4,3,2), (2,3,5,4)(6,7,8,9,10),
            (2,3,5,4)(6,10,9,8,7), (1,5,3,4), (1,4,5,2)(6,8,10,7,9),
            (1,4,5,2)(6,9,7,10,8), (2,5)(3,4)(6,7,8,9,10),
            (2,5)(3,4)(6,10,9,8,7), (1,5)(2,4)(6,8,10,7,9),
            (1,5)(2,4)(6,9,7,10,8), (1,4)(2,3), (1,3)(4,5)(6,7,8,9,10),
            (1,3)(4,5)(6,8,10,7,9), (1,3)(4,5)(6,9,7,10,8),
            (1,3)(4,5)(6,10,9,8,7), (1,2)(3,5), (2,4,5,3)(6,7,8,9,10),
            (2,4,5,3)(6,10,9,8,7), (1,4,3,5), (1,2,5,4)(6,8,10,7,9),
            (1,2,5,4)(6,9,7,10,8)]
           </output>
        </sage>

        <p>Here \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) are our original generators and \(C\) is a subset of \(G\) consisting of elements of the form \(x^iy^jz^k\). So they are specified by triples \((i,j,k)\) and <c>ds</c> is indeed a set of triples. We perform a partial check on our work by testing if \(C\) is inverse-closed.</p>

        <sage>
            <input>all( [x^-1 in C for x in C] )</input>
            <output>True</output>
        </sage>

        <p>By default, Sage creates Cayley graphs that are have directed edges. So we need to convert to an undirected graph.</p>

        <sage>
            <input>G = H1.cayley_graph( generators=C).to_undirected()</input>
        </sage>

        <p>How can we confirm that this is the Higman-Sims graph?  Well, it is connected, regular, and has exactly three eigenvalues (as we see in the factored characteristic polynomial):</p>

        <sage>
            <input>G.is_connected(), G.is_regular(), G.am().fcp()</input>
            <output>(True, True, (x - 22) * (x + 8)^22 * (x - 2)^77)</output>
        </sage>

        <p>Since the Higman-Sims graph is determined by its eigenvalues, we have it. We used <c>G.am().fcp()</c> to get the factored characteristic polynomial of \(G\), because it's shorter than <c>G.characteristic_polynomial().factor()</c> even with tab completion. Also, for a graph on any significant number of vertices there is very little to be gained by looking at the coefficients of its characteristic polynomial<mdash/>they are far too large!</p>

        <p>We can use <c>G.girth()</c> to see that \(G\) is triangle-free and we can see that \(G\) is vertex transitive.</p>

        <sage>
            <input>G.girth(), G.is_vertex_transitive()</input>
            <output>(4, True)</output>
        </sage>

        <p>To verify that \(G\) is arc-transitive, we prove more by showing that the stabilizer of a vertex has exactly three orbits on vertices. We set things up with</p>

        <sage>
            <input>
            G.relabel()
            part = [[0], [1..99]]
            orbs = G.automorphism_group( return_group=False, partition=part, orbits=True)
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>Some explanations are in order. As created the vertices of \(G\) are permutations, after <c>G.relabel()</c> they are the integers in \([0..99]\). Now <c>part</c> is a simple partition of \(G\), isolating the vertex \(0\).  Then <c>orbs</c> is the list of orbits of the subgroup of automorphisms of \(G\) that fix each cell of the partition <c>part</c>, effectively the stabiliser of the vertex \(0\). From</p>

        <sage>
            <input>len(orbs)</input>
            <output>3</output>
        </sage>

        <p>we infer that the vertex stabiliser has three orbits, which must be 0, the neighbors of 0 and the vertices at distance two from 0. We conclude that \(\aut G\) is a rank-three permutation group. Its order?</p>

        <sage>
            <input>G.automorphism_group(return_group=False,order=True)</input>
            <output>88704000</output>
        </sage>

        <p>The Higman-Sims graph contains many triangle-free srg's as subgraphs. For example, the subgraphs obtained by deleting a vertex and its neighbors, or by deleting two adjacent vertices and its neighbors. Its vertices can be partitioned into two copies of the Hoffman-Singleton graph, but that's another story.</p>

    <section xml:id="section-600-cell">
        <title>The 600-Cell</title>

        <p>It's a wikifact that if \(f:=(1+\sqrt{5})/2\), then the vertices of a 600-cell centered at the origin of 4-space with edges of length \(1/f\) can be given as follows: <ol>
            <li> 16 vertices of the form <me>\frac12(\pm1,\pm1,\pm1,\pm1)</me></li>
            <li> 8 vertices obtained from all permutations of the coordinates of <me>(\pm1,0,0,0)</me></li>
            <li> 96 vertices obtained by taking all even permutations of <me>\frac12\left(\pm1,\pm f,\pm f^{-1},0\right).</me></li>
        </ol></p>

        <p>The first step is produce a \(120\times 4\) matrix \(U\) with these vectors its rows. The game is to do this without using a for-loop. We set up our background,</p>

        <sage>
            <input>
            x = QQ['x'].0
            K.&lt;f&gt; = NumberField(x^2-x-1)
            RR4 = VectorSpace(K,4) 
            H.&lt;i,j,k&gt; = QuaternionAlgebra(K,-1,-1)
            </input>
        </sage>

        <p>So we work with quaternions over \(\rats(f)\), where \(f\) is a zero of \(f^2-f-1\). Due to an unfortunate feature of Python, we must remember now <em>never</em> to use \(i\) or \(j\) or \(k\) as an index in a list comprehension.  If we evaluate <c>[i^2 for i in [1..5]]</c> the value of \(i\) becomes \(5\) once complete.</p>

        <p>Now we create \(U\). </p>

        <p>Comparing the number of quaternions with given reduced trace with the sizes of the orbits of the vertex stabilizer, suggests that the two partitions are equal. You should verify this. You should also verify that the multiplicative order of an element of <c>qu</c> is determined by its reduced trace. (Use <c>qq.order()</c>.) In particular the quaternions with reduced trace \(f\) or \(1-f\) have order 10. The quaternions in <c>qu</c> form a multiplicative group isomorphic to \(SL(2,5)\). You can access this group in Sage by</p>

        </sage>

        <p>The 600-cell is a Cayley graph for this group with a connection set consisting of a conjugacy class of elements of order 10. There are two such conjugacy classes, one formed by the elements with reduced trace \(f\) and the other consisting of the elements of reduced trace \(1-f\). We show now that the Cayley graph with respect to the first of these conjugacy classes is isomorphic to \(DC\), you should verify that the second is.</p>

        <p>The natural choice for the vertices of a cubelike graph are the elements of</p>

        <p>but these are not hashable. We can make a vector <c>v</c> hashable with <c>v.set_immutable()</c> and use vectors as vertices, or work as follows.  Suppose that <c>vls</c> is a list of vectors from a vector space <c>V</c>.</p>

        <p>For humans it can be convenient to encode binary vectors of length \(d\) as integers between 0 and \(2^{d-1}\). With \(G\) as just defined, its connection set will be the correct set of integers.</p>
